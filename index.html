    <h1>Internet is Easy. The Lesson 4 teaches on how to use H, P, OL, L, UL Code for you</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic html. HTML is the words only</p>

    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of our webpage. There are six levels of headings. H1 is bigger than H2</p>


    <h2>Unordered Lists</h2>
    <p>This is how we make an unordered lists. Type UL then LI. The parent code is UL. The list are bulleted.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list) </li>
      <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
      <li>They don't need to be in any particular order.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ordered/Numbered List</h2>
    <p>This is how we make an ordered list. OL is the parent code then the child code is LI. The lists are in numbered order when there is OL parent code. </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Notice the "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
      <li>But the list item elements are the same</li>
      <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>We should be noticing things is in precise order because this is an ordered list</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
    <p><em>Sometimes,</em> we need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
    <p>Other items, we need to <strong>strongly</strong> emphasis the importance of a word or phrase</p>
    <p>The em code is for the word to be italicized</p>
    <p> The Strong code is for the word to be bold.</p>

    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
    <p>Thanks for reading! Learning HTML should be getting easier now</p>
    <p>Regards, <hr/>Kodego Instructor</p>
